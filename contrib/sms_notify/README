Extremely simple wrapper scripts for ASPSMS, which can be used on the shell. I am using
these scripts to send out nagios.org monitoring notifications via SMS. 

Installation instructions:
- edit sms_config.php-dist, enter username/password/originator etc., save as sms_config.php
- make sure the shebang line #!/usr/bin/php points to the PHP interpreter on your
  system. You can search for php with `which php`.
- make sure sms_notify and sms_creditcheck are executable, otherwise do a
  `chmod +x sms_notify` and `chmod +x sms_creditcheck`
- put SMS.inc into the same directory (or adjust the include lines to the path where
  SMS.inc can be located)

Have fun.
